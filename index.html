                                    <p>
                                        The Premier League is the most popular soccer league in the world, drawing global fans with various team affiliations. The pressure to
                                        constantly have the best quality of soccer leads teams to constantly be on the lookout for the best players they can find, which leads to a
                                        unique global ‚Äútransfer market‚Äùwhere teams buy and sell players to fill out their rosters. Naturally, this creates an atmosphere where
                                        each professional soccer player has a value associated with them, known as their transfer value, which is supposed to represent the cost
                                        that a club would have to pay to buy him. The larger teams will often spend tens of millions of dollars to buy players from smaller teams
                                        and they will generate the most fans and the biggest wins. The question is, how much do player‚Äôs values represent their ability? This
                                        project thus aims to create a model that is able to predict the transfer value of soccer players based on their available statistics, leaving
                                        the league with a tool thats able to, without bias, evaluate players against each other and allowing players to value themselves against
                                        other players with similar statistics and characteristics.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The core problem this project addresses revolves around the correlation between a soccer player's
                                        transfer value and their actual performance, specifically in the context of the English Premier League.
                                        Despite being a central aspect of the global soccer economy, the transfer market's valuation of players
                                        often raises questions about its accuracy and efficacy. The problem lies in determining how well these
                                        values reflect a player's true ability to contribute to a team's success. Larger clubs frequently invest
                                        substantial sums in acquiring players, yet it's unclear if these expenditures translate into
                                        commensurate improvements in club performance, such as more wins or better league standings.
                                        Additionally, the project seeks to identify the types of players who tend to exceed or fall short of the
                                        expectations set by their transfer values. This includes examining if there is a consistent pattern in the
                                        types of players who overperform or underperform based on criteria like age, position, or nationality.
                                        By addressing these issues, the study aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of player
                                        valuation in the transfer market, offering valuable insights for club management strategies and the
                                        broader soccer community.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Motivations</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The motivation for this project stems from a desire to deeply understand the intricacies of the Premier
                                        League's transfer market, a key element in maintaining the high quality of play that has made it the
                                        most popular soccer league in the world. This market assigns monetary values to players, a practice
                                        that raises questions about the true representation of a player's ability and contribution to team
                                        success. The study aims to explore whether these transfer values genuinely reflect player
                                        performance and, by extension, whether the substantial investments made by clubs in acquiring
                                        players are justified. A significant part of this motivation is also to provide insights that could enhance
                                        the strategic planning of clubs in their transfer activities, ensuring more effective allocation of
                                        resources for better team performance. Furthermore, while the focus is on the Premier League, the
                                        findings are anticipated to have broader implications, potentially informing strategies in other soccer
                                        leagues worldwide. This project, therefore, bridges the gap between the numerical values in the
                                        transfer market and actual on-field performance, offering a comprehensive understanding of the
                                        economics of soccer and its influence on the game‚Äôs competitive balance and quality.

                                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This project aims to investigate the correlation between a soccer player's market value and their
                                        performance, particularly in the English Premier League. It focuses on analyzing various factors
                                        including club values, player costs, and actual performance outcomes such as league standings,
                                        goals scored and conceded, and possession statistics. The objective is to evaluate the cost
                                        effectiveness of player transfers and determine their financial return. Additionally, the project
                                        seeks to identify player profiles that deliver high impact at relatively low costs, aiding in strategic
                                        decision-making for team management. This involves detailed statistical analysis, demographic
                                        investigation, and advanced data processing techniques, including OneHotEncoding and data
                                        integration, to create a comprehensive dataset for in-depth analysis. By uncovering the most
                                        impactful metrics in the prediction of a players transfer value, soccer players and club
                                        management alike could analyze cost-effectiveness and develop player profiles that have more
                                        inherent worth in the UK soccer community.

                                    <p>
                                        In our data analysis project, we began by loading datasets on players' profiles, valuations, and match appearances using pandas. We
                                        first filtered out entries with missing 'position' and 'agent_name' from the players' dataset to ensure data quality. Next, we employed
                                        a OneHotEncoder to numerically transform key categorical variables like competition IDs, positions, agent names, foot preference,
                                        and nationalities. This transformation was crucial to handle categorical data effectively. The encoded data, with newly generated
                                        column names, was then integrated back into the players' dataset after removing the original categorical columns. We streamlined
                                        the dataset by discarding less relevant columns like 'city_of_birth' and 'image_url', focusing on more impactful attributes. From the
                                        appearances dataset, we aggregated vital performance metrics such as goals, assists, and cards by player ID, providing a cumulative
                                        view of each player's on-field contributions. These enriched player profiles were then merged with the performance statistics.
                                        Additionally, we transformed 'date_of_birth' into an 'age' feature for more insightful analysis. After dropping NaN values, we
                                        obtained a final dataset that combines detailed player characteristics, performance data, and market values, offering a rich
                                        foundation for subsequent analytical exploration.
                                        Expanding on this comprehensive data preparation, we then meticulously structured our predictive model's feature set. Utilizing the
                                        one-hot encoded columns for country, club, foot, position, and agent data, alongside core performance metrics like yellow cards,
                                        goals, assists, and minutes played, we assembled a robust array of variables. This multi-faceted feature set was split into training
                                        and testing datasets, reserving 20% for testing, to robustly model and predict players' highest market values, leveraging the
                                        nuanced relationships within the data. Additionally in order to better analyze which features had the largest impact on our models we
                                        created visualizations which we could use to retroactively tweak the model to improve the r2 score (as shown below).  Concluding

                                        KNN Regression Model:
                                        Utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression in
                                        analyzing Premier League data offers simplicity and
                                        interpretability, which are significant advantages.
                                        However, its suitability is questionable for our project
                                        due to its limitations in handling noisy data and
                                        computational inefficiency with large datasets. Given
                                        our project's emphasis on managing large and complex
                                        datasets, these drawbacks render KNN less ideal. While
                                        its straightforward approach could offer clear insights,
                                        these technical constraints suggest the need for a more

                                        dimensional data (which we have plenty of), they're
                                        versatile thanks to the kernel trick. But here's the
                                        issue: they're not the best with big datasets and can
                                        get tripped up by noisy data. Considering how
                                        soccer player valuations vary a lot and SVM relies on
                                        closeness to data points, it might not be the most
                                        efficient choice for our analysis.<br /> <br />
                                        Random Tree Model Regression:
                                        The Random Forest regression model is particularly
                                        effective for our project because it handles non-linear
                                        data well, which is crucial given the complexity of soccer
                                        player valuations. It's also strong against overfitting,
                                        ensuring more reliable predictions. The downside is its
                                        complexity and high computational demands, particularly
                                        with large datasets, and it's not as straightforward to
                                        interpret. Overall, its ability to manage diverse data
                                        types and resist overfitting makes it a viable option for
                                        our analysis.

                                    <h3>Relative Success with Random Tree Regresor Model</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        After extensive analysis of various models, we identified the Random Forest Regressor as the most effective in predicting player
                                        transfer values. Notably, the model with 140 estimators yielded the best results, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of
                                        34,748,586,321,505.96 and an R¬≤ Score of 0.746. While this performance surpasses other models, it still doesn't reach an ideal level
                                        of prediction accuracy for such a complex and dynamic market. The challenges in accurately modeling player transfer values are
                                        multifaceted. Firstly, the player transfer market is highly complex, with a multitude of influencing factors like performance statistics,
                                        age, position, market trends, and club dynamics. These variables are interwoven and subject to frequent changes. Our model
                                        incorporates these statistics, but the subjective nature of player evaluations often weakens the predictability of transfer values. In real
                                        world scenarios, player valuation heavily relies on subjective assessments from scouts, managers, and experts, who look beyond mere
                                        statistics to make judgment calls. This introduces a level of unpredictability and variability that our model can't fully capture. Moreover,
                                        the transfer market is influenced by external factors such as economic conditions, global events, and club-specific strategies, which
                                        can significantly alter player valuations. These dynamic market conditions create a range of values that can fluctuate widely based on
                                        current events or market shifts. Additionally, the relationships between input features and transfer values are likely non-linear and
                                        constantly evolving, adding another layer of complexity to our modeling efforts. Despite these challenges, our model offers a significant
                                        step forward in understanding and predicting player transfer values,  though it falls short of fully capturing the intricate dynamics of
                                        the football transfer market. With the assistance of intentional and comprehensive feature encoding, as well as hyper-parameter
                                        turning we were able to create a model with an r2 of .746 and a mse of roughly 5.8 million. Given that the valuation of soccer players
                                        in our data set ranged from less than 1 million to over 500 million dollars, we believe this to be an objective success. And if use in
                                        tandem with expert advice could provide some interesting insight for the presidents of soccer clubs.

                                    <h3>Comparison with similar existing models</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The development of models to predict transfer or market values of soccer players is a challenging task, and existing similar models in the
                                        field of soccer/futbol struggle to achieve consistently high r2 scores. A key reason for this difficulty is the impact of external factors,
                                        particularly the popularity or notoriety of players on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter. Studies by Li, Kampakis, Treleaven,
                                        Fazenda, Costa, Garcia-Mas, and Carvalho (2022) highlight the significant role that the presence of a player's name in online discussions
                                        plays in influencing these models. The popularity of players in such threads can skew the data, making it difficult to accurately predict their
                                        market value based solely on performance or statistical data. Li states in his conclusion that a key way his model could be improved is
                                        through the includion of popularity metrics, stating ‚ÄúWhen selecting the features and getting the data, this research fails to get the data
                                        expressing the popularity of players (e.g., Wikipedia page views, Reddit posts). Therefore, to make the research more comprehensive, the
                                        popularity data of players need to be obtained‚Äù (Li, et al, 2022). Moreover McHale, while stating that Twitter followers wasn't a statistically
                                        significant feature in his own model, admits that in similar models it has been an effective means to increase r2 scores and the subsequent
                                        reliability of the model (McHale, et al, 2022) This highlights the complexity and the multifaceted nature of valuing soccer players, where
                                        online presence and public perception can significantly impact model outcomes. In summary, in comparison with other models in the field of
                                        soccer analytics, our model has room to improve but also performs comparatively well.

                                    <h3>Ways to Improve</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To enhance our model's accuracy in predicting player transfer values, several improvements can be
                                        implemented. First, incorporating more granular and diverse data points, such as detailed player
                                        performance metrics over multiple seasons, psychological assessments, and injury history, could
                                        provide a more holistic view of a player's value. Additionally, integrating external factors like market
                                        trends, economic conditions, and club financial health could capture the dynamic nature of the transfer
                                        market more effectively. Implementing advanced machine learning techniques like ensemble methods
                                        or deep learning could also help capture complex, non-linear relationships within the data. Regularly
                                        updating the model with recent data and trends will ensure its relevance over time. Additionally,
                                        collaboration with football experts to include subjective assessments and tacit knowledge in the model
                                        could bridge the gap between statistical analysis and real-world evaluations, potentially leading to more
                                        accurate predictions. Including qualitative (turned quantitative) could thus be invaluable. In the future
                                        as we continue to work on this model, we believe that the incorporation of these factors could lead to a
                                        tool accurate enough (in this context accuracy is a higher r2 score) to be used in a professional
                                        environment.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>The Impact</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        We acknowledge that our model is far from perfect; however, we firmly believe that a model of its kind, or even an
                                        enhanced version of the same model with more extensive and diverse data, has the potential to have a profound impact on
                                        the global soccer community. This impact extends beyond the world of soccer fans and enthusiasts and can influence
                                        society as a whole. With the creation of a predictive model for player transfer valuations in the dynamic transfer market,
                                        we open the door to several opportunities. Our model can address subtle biases in player valuation, ensure fair
                                        recognition of talent from regions like the global south, analyze the factors contributing to player desirability, promote
                                        data-driven discussions in mainstream media, and foster inclusivity and diversity within the sport. Since a large amount of
                                        recruiting is done overseas in countries like Senegal, India, Ghana and Nigeria, a tool that allows players to know their
                                        worth comparatively could lead to a more equitable and fair compensation system. With the model itself serving as way to
                                        increase pay transparency in the field. If this model additionally were adapted to include more statistics about women, it
                                        could be a tool used in the conversation about the gender pay gap in athletics. And finally it could lead to a more
                                        interesting game! Through the creation of a tool that can conversely be used by the presidents of clubs to put together a
                                        team of (cost-effective) high performing players the sport itself would inevitably have more interesting matches, like the
                                        World Cup coming up.  Ultimately, by continuing to refine and expand upon this model, we can contribute to a more
                                        equitable and data-driven approach to player valuation, benefiting fans, players, and clubs while enhancing the overall
                                        soccer community.

                                    <h2>Conlusion</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        We set out to create a robust model for predicting soccer player transfer valuations, intending to accurately correlate
                                        player performance with their market value. And we did just that. Utilizing a Random Forest Regressor with 140
                                        estimators, achieving an R¬≤ score of 0.746, our journey has been enlightening, challenging and relatively successful.
                                        Our final and most recent iteration of the model not only marks significant advancement from previous versions, but it
                                        also underscores the inherent complexities in player valuation. Our objective was to create a model that is able to
                                        predict the transfer value of soccer players based on their available statistics, leaving the league with a tool thats able
                                        to, without bias, evaluate players against each other and allowing players to value themselves against other players
                                        with similar statistics and characteristics, while also identifying emerging trends. Through the creation of a model with
                                        an r2 we have begun to do just that, with room for improvement on this iteration. Despite hurdles, our model shows
                                        potential in positively influencing the soccer world. It's not just about technical prowess; our ambition is to leverage
                                        data science for fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and analytically informed soccer community. As we look ahead,
                                        our commitment is steadfast in refining our approach, enriching our dataset with more diverse variables, and
                                        continuing collaborative efforts to push the frontiers of data science in soccer (and athletics in general), ultimately
                                        making a meaningful contribution to the sport's analytical landscape.

                            The founder of "Karaka≈ülar Group" requested an application to streamline the approval of worker requests, leading to the creation of a system with three types of accounts: manager, employee, and accountant. Employees can submit entries for necessary items, which managers can approve or decline, while accountants monitor all entries without approval rights. The application features secure login, personalized entry visibility, categorization, and historical data analysis. CLICK TO READ MORE

                            My sister and I, as juniors in high school, launched a heartfelt initiative: we interviewed inspiring personalities and compiled a book to fund the purchase of medical equipment for a pediatric hospital. Proceeds from our book sales are also set to support educational endeavors, providing tablets and chess sets for middle schoolers, complemented by online chess and coding classes. Our endeavor has been a success, selling 600 copies in just a month, fueled by social media and notable endorsements. CLICK TO READ MORE
